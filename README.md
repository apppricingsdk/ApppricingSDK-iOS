# AppPricingSDK - iOS

AppPricing SDK is an intelligent pricing optimization tool for mobile applications. It analyzes user behavior and characteristics to determine the most appropriate pricing strategy for each individual user.

By integrating this SDK, your app will receive smart recommendations for which paywall to display based on sophisticated backend analysis that categorizes users into different purchasing tiers (e.g., premium, standard, or basic pricing segments).
